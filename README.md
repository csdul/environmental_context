# Node 2. Environmental Context
During the past decade, [**CANUE**](https://canuedata.ca/) has been working to provide a clearly documented and accessible range of local-level national urban exposure metrics reflecting conditions from 1980 onward.[^1] Their data portal now contains over 50 area-level measures of environmental determinants covering things like greenness, built environments, transportation, gentrification, air quality, and noise and light pollution. [**Dr. Daniel Fuller**](https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/che/daniel-fuller.php), who is also one of the team leaders for Neighbourhood Factors with CANUE, will lead Node 2 to assemble and validate a set of simplified CANUE environmental variables and supporting documentation to be added to [CSDUL](https://github.com/csdul/pre_beta_csdul_introduction). In addition, in partnership with a project funded by the [Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/about-us), he will advance the development of two new national datasets that describe housing affordability that will also be included in CSDUL. The first is a standard metric for housing affordability published by CMHC. The second is a [low-end-of-the-market (LEM)](https://lemr.ca/) rental housing dataset. Low-income households are limited and forced to rely on the low-income market to meet their housing needs. The LEM will quantify the magnitude of this dependency and identify where it is most acute within Canada’s major cities. Fuller’s team will also be responsible for analysis related to joining and merging spatial datasets of different types (points, lines, and polygons) and different geographic extents (dissemination area versus federal electoral districts).
